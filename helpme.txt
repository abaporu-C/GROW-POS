to the deletion page doesn't alter our database.

Deletion of households memberships are restricted to administrators only.

1-6) Can I delete a household with members attached to it?

No. For safety reasons, we decided that it's better to restrict household deletions to empty households only. You will need to delete all the members on that household 
prior to deleting the whole membership.

This ensures that you don't accidentaly delete members' informations.

1-7) How LICO verification works?

For your convenience, the LICO verification runs automatically on the background so you don't need to think about it while adding a new member.
It will update the household information every time you add or edit a new member.

1-8) What if a member is over the LICO Threshold for just a bit?

A Super Administrator can judge situations like these case to case. They have the ability to toggle LICO verification status on a household at will.

1-9) What if a member doesn't have a fixed address?

While creating the household, there is a No Fixed Address check box on the top of the form. Check that box so the household will have GROW address as their own.

1-10) Where would a Super Administrator be able to change LICO Verification status of a household?

On the household details page, the Super Admin will have access to a button on the top of the page that will change the LICO status at their will.
