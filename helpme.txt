You will be prompted with a form to create a new household. After you fill in the Household information, you will be presented to add a new member to your newly created
membership.

You don't need to add a member to a household right away. As soon as the household information is entered, it will be saved in our database and you can

add a new member to it straight away. 

Click on the green person icon with a plus on it to add a new member to an existing household.

For your convenience, we also added an add button inside the detailed household page. Once in the index page, click on the blue info icon to navigate to the Details Page.

household membership.

delete confirmation page. There, you will be asked to confirm the deletion. Don't worry, the household will only be deleted after you confirmed it. Just navigating
to the deletion page doesn't alter our database.

Deletion of households memberships are restricted to administrators only.

1-6) Can I delete a household with members attached to it?

No. For safety reasons, we decided that it's better to restrict household deletions to empty households only. You will need to delete all the members on that household 
prior to deleting the whole membership.

This ensures that you don't accidentaly delete members' informations.

1-7) How LICO verification works?

For your convenience, the LICO verification runs automatically on the background so you don't need to think about it while adding a new member.
It will update the household information every time you add or edit a new member.

1-8) What if a member is over the LICO Threshold for just a bit?

A Super Administrator can judge situations like these case to case. They have the ability to toggle LICO verification status on a household at will.

1-9) What if a member doesn't have a fixed address?

While creating the household, there is a No Fixed Address check box on the top of the form. Check that box so the household will have GROW address as their own.

1-10) Where would a Super Administrator be able to change LICO Verification status of a household?

On the household details page, the Super Admin will have access to a button on the top of the page that will change the LICO status at their will.
